# Qubitrix
A 3D falling block puzzle game primarily inspired by Tetris.

Note: The only controller supported at the moment is the PlayStation 4 controller (as it is the only one I have been able to test so far). Using other controllers may yield unexpected results.

Controls:\n
WASD, D-pad or left analog stick - move the piece horizontally\n
K/L, Square/Circle or right analog stick - rotate the view of the grid\n
Space, Cross or R1 - lower the piece\n
Holding Shift or L1 with the horizontal movement or rotation buttons will rotate the piece in any of 6 directions.\n
Semicolon (;), Triangle or L2 - hold the current piece\n
Esc or touch pad click - pause the game
